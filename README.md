# Asteroid-Game
This holds the project files for Asteroid Game

This game was made as part of an assignment for module COMP222 at the University of Liverpool. As such the game was completed from scratch in 1-2 weeks.
Most game assets were made by myself, e.g. spaceship,meteors. However, the sound effects are not my own and were bought from teh Unity Asset Store.
